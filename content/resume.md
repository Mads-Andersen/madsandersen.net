* **2021 Jan - Now: Senior Software Engineer at GoodMonday.io**  
Most of my work has been on the backend where one of the features I have built is a calendar system that was made from scratch. Since the team is small I have taken ownership of the infrastructure and improved it with more automation. The backend is written in Elixir and the infrastructure is based on AWS.

* **2017 Nov - Sep 2020: Infrastructure Engineer at GAN Integrity**  
The first year and a half I worked on the backend for the Campaign and Training module. The existing product was unstable and the company wanted a complete rewrite using a relational database. The work involved introducing a PostgreSQL database and migrating existing non-relational data into relational data. Later I changed my role to Infrastructure Engineer where I automated pipelines and build tools that helped productivity for the other developers in the company.

Developing and maintaining the backend services of the Engage product. This involved moving the project out of a monolithic service and rewrite it into a new and improved microservice architecture.

* **2013 Sep - Feb 2015: Software Engineer at Eniro**  
Was involved in developing a web crawler and a web scraper. The web crawler was a Hadoop cluster that fetched millions of web pages every day. The web scraper automatically identified and extracted entities from the web pages that were fetched by the web crawler. The two projects were developed in Java and communicated with each other via queues and REST interfaces.
