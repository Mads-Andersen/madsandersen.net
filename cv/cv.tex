    {2021 - Now}
    {Senior Software Engineer}
    {Good Monday}
    {Most of my work has been on the backend where one of the features I have built is a calendar system that was made from scratch. Since the team is small I have taken ownership of the infrastructure and improved it with more automation. The backend is written in Elixir and the infrastructure is based on AWS..}
    \entry
    {2020 - 2020}
    {Senior Software Engineer}
    {Proper}
    {Optimized the CI/CD pipeline and worked on integrating e-conomic into their platform.}
    \entry
    {2017 - 2020}
    {Infrastructure Engineer}
    {GAN Integrity}
    {The first year and a half I worked on the backend for the Campaign and Training module. The existing product was unstable and the company wanted a complete rewrite using a relational database.  
    The work involved introducing a PostgreSQL database and migrating existing non-relational data into relational data.
    A year ago I changed role to devops engineer where I automated pipelines and build tools that helped productivity for the other developers in the company.}
    \entry
    {2015 - 2017}
    {Software Engineer}
    {Falcon.io}
    {Developing and maintaining the backend services of the Engage product. This involved moving the project out of a monolithic service and rewriting it into a new and improved microservice architecture. The product handles millions of messages from social media networks that are stored in a way so the users of the platform have access to their conversations in milliseconds to which they can act on.}
    \entry
    {2013 - 2015}
    {Software Engineer}
    {Eniro}
    {Developing and maintaining a web crawler and a web scraper. The web crawler involved running a Hadoop cluster system that fetched millions of web pages every day. The web scraper automatically identified and extracted entities from the web pages that were fetched by the web crawler.}
